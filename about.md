Welcome to my journey to the software world!

I'm of EE background. Like, pure electronics: I know how silicon atoms form transistors, how transistors form circuits, how circuits form ICs, and how ICs become circuit boards and transfer Monday night football to our TVs.
Now it's time for me to see the other side of the world :)

I did lots of scripting in VB, tcl and some C#. I am starting MakerSquare in Austin which focuses on javascript, at the same time hoping to keep up with my java and C# learning. 

English is not my first language, so in some way I am learning that language too (and man it's so illogical!)
