It's been 2 days and hasn't really sinked in yet. I quitted my old job 4 weeks before the start of the camp, to do pre-course work and just relax, so I'd say I'm very prepared. However, I still found lots to learn at the first 2 days, which focused on reviewing the pre-course material.

One big thing is *passing functions*. It's very easy to mix up when functions are evaluated and when it's passed, especially if the function returns a function. My take is, *at the end it all comes down to the parentesis*.

*Variable scoping* is not difficult to understand, but very easy to mess up.
